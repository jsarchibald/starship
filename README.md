A simple web game I wrote in October 2015 to help learn irregular French passe simple conjugations.

## Usage

Using just the client-side game is fine; just open `index.html` in any modern web browser and have fun.

If you want to use the PHP scoreboard features, you'll need to set up a standard PHP + web server combo. When I first wrote this I used XAMPP for testing, and the LAMP stack for presenting to my class, if only because those were the setups I already had set up.

## Disclaimer

I haven't modified this code since 2015. It does not represent the best design practices, but it was a fun project I stumbled upon while browsing my old files.
